# Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction

Welcome! I’m the creator of **xno.click**, and I’m a strong believer in digital privacy.  
This platform is designed to store as little data as necessary while maintaining functionality and security.  

This **Privacy Policy** outlines what data is collected, how it’s used, and how it’s protected.  
It applies to all aspects of the service — both for registered users and anyone interacting with shortened links.

---

## 2. Data Collected

**xno.click** is built with minimal data collection in mind.  
However, some information is required for the service to function properly and securely:

- **Created Links:** Nano address, shortened URL, and destination URL  
- **User Settings:** Nano address and personal preferences  
- **Link Impressions (for earning links):** IP address and User-Agent string (browser/device info)

> No unnecessary tracking is performed, and no personally identifiable data is collected beyond what's listed above.

---

## 3. Purpose of Data Collection

Data collected on **xno.click** serves the following purposes:

- **Service Functionality:** Linking Nano addresses to short URLs, remembering user settings, and delivering rewards  
- **Abuse Prevention:** IP and User-Agent data help detect and prevent fraud, such as fake clicks or bot traffic  
- **Security and Integrity:** Ensures fair usage of the platform and helps maintain system stability  

Any data not strictly required for core functionality is collected solely for anti-abuse and security purposes.

---

## 4. How Data is Used

All collected data is used solely to operate and improve the **xno.click** service. Specifically:

- **Created Links data** ensures that links can be resolved correctly and tied to the correct Nano address for payouts or analytics.  
- **User Settings** allow customization of the user experience.  
- **IP Addresses and User-Agents** are primarily used for detecting abuse (e.g., repeated impressions from the same source, bots, or click farms) and ensuring fair reward distribution.  

> None of this data is used for tracking users across the web, profiling, or advertising purposes.

---

## 5. Data Sharing

I do **not** sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal data with third parties.  
The only exceptions where data may be shared are:

- **Legal Requirements:** If compelled by a court order or government authority.  
- **Security Measures:** In cases of abuse, fraud, or attacks, relevant data may be shared with infrastructure providers (e.g., anti-DDoS services) to mitigate risks.

---

## 6. Data Retention

Data is stored only as long as necessary:

- **Link and impression data** may be retained for up to 30 days for fraud analysis before being anonymized or deleted.  
- **User preferences** are stored until the user deletes their account or resets their settings.  

You can contact me at any time to request deletion of your data.

---

## 7. Cookies and Tracking

**xno.click** does not use third-party tracking cookies.  

A **local storage UUID token** is used for authentication.  
It resets every login/logout for security purposes.

Cookies are used only for:
- User authentication  
- Human-unreadable checksums of previously visited links  

> You’re free to block both local storage and cookie use — though doing so may break key functionality. (Not recommended.)

---

## 8. Data Security

I take reasonable steps to protect your data. This includes:

- Secure **HTTPS** connections for all data transfers  
- **Hashing** or **encrypting** sensitive data where possible  
- Regular **security reviews** of code and infrastructure  

While no system is 100% secure, I’m committed to doing my best to protect both the platform and your information.

---

## 9. Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Request access to any personal data stored about you  
- Ask for corrections or deletions  
- Withdraw consent where applicable  

You can contact me via the methods listed in the website footer for any such requests.

---

## 10. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated from time to time, especially as the platform evolves or if laws change.  
If changes are significant, I’ll do my best to announce them clearly.
